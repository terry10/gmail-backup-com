About:
======
Gmail Backup allows to backup and restore the content of your Gmail account. It
uses the IMAP protocol to fetch and store your messages. It can also be used to
migrate your messages between two accounts, for example between your private
inbox and the Google Apps acount.

This project contains the open sourced code of Gmail Backup
(hosted at www.gmail-backup.com).
